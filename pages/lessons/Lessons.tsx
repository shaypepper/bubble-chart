            Tips and tricks for using this tool
            <ul>
              <li>
                Color is like a good moisturizer or a pigmented eyeshadow. A
                little bit goes a long way.
              </li>
              <li>
                Think outside of the box when grouping employees. You don&apos;t
                just have to organize by the company&apos;s org chart.
              </li>
              <li>
                Combine columns to provide more granularity and specificity in
                your groupings
              </li>
              <li>Always include the point person. Always.</li>
              <li>
                Is there a feature missing? You can probably use google sheets
                to get your data the way you need it before importing it here!
